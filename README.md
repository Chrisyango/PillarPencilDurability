PencilDurability is an application designed to simulate how a real pencil works.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
First things first, you'll need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer.
You can find a tutorial on how to install them here:

After installing Node.js and NPM, you'll need to install all of the dependancies associated with the application. This can be easily done by using the terminal.

First, you'll want to go into the folder where you downloaded the application.
